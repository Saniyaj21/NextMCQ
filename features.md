Saniyaj, this is a *brilliant idea*! You're hitting multiple sweet spots:

## 🧱 *Platform Name Ideas (Optional)*  
Some brainstorming names (you can finalize later):
- *Quizly*  
- *EduTest*  
- *MCQChamp*  
- *NeoLearn*  
- *TestNest*

---

## 📲 Tech Stack (Suggested)

### Web App
- *Frontend*: Next.js or React.js + Tailwind CSS
- *Backend*: Node.js + Express
- *Database*: MongoDB (great for flexibility in storing MCQs)
- *Auth*: Firebase or JWT-based system
- *Hosting*: Vercel / Render / Railway

### Android App (Later Phase)
- *Option 1*: Flutter (easy to integrate with backend and cross-platform)
- *Option 2*: React Native (if you want JS across stack)

## 🚀 Marketing & Growth Plan

### 📣 Get Users

## 💼 Monetization Ideas (Later)

1. *Freemium Model*:
   - Free for most, charge for premium features (detailed analytics, mock sets from toppers, etc.)

2. *Institution/Coach Subscriptions*:
   - Let teachers subscribe to premium plans for managing batches, detailed analytics, branding

3. *Ad Revenue* (Carefully):  
   - Show minimal, non-distracting ads to free users only

4. *Certification*: Offer mock tests + certifications in future subjects (like programming, reasoning, etc.)
